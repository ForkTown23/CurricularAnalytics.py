"""
Curriculum data type:
The required curriculum associated with a degree program.

The curriculum-based metrics in this toolbox are based upon the graph structure of a
curriculum.  Specifically, assume curriculum ``c`` consists of ``n`` courses ``\\{c_1, \\ldots, c_n\\}``,
and that there are ``m`` requisite (prerequisite or co-requsitie) relationships between these courses.
A curriculum graph ``G_c = (V,E)`` is formed by creating a vertex set ``V = \\{v_1, \\ldots, v_n\\}``
(i.e., one vertex for each course) along with an edge set ``E = \\{e_1, \\ldots, e_m\\}``, where a
directed edge from vertex ``v_i`` to ``v_j`` is in ``E`` if course ``c_i`` is a requisite for course ``c_j``.

        Finds all courses in the curriculum that appear at the end of a path (i.e., sink vertices).  If a course does not have a prefix, it is excluded from

            and do *not* have `BIO` as a prefix.  One might consider these courses "dead ends," as their course outcomes are not used by any
